Vulnerability Scan Report Analysis and Mitigation
Overview
A vulnerability scan was performed using Tenable Nessus Essentials on the localhost IP address 192.168.220.236. The scan identified a total of 35 vulnerabilities, with the following severity distribution:

Critical: 0
High: 0
Medium: 2
Low: 0
Info: 33

This document focuses on the two medium-risk vulnerabilities identified in the scan:

SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted (Plugin ID: 51192, CVSS v3.0: 6.5)
SMB Signing Not Required (Plugin ID: 57608, CVSS v3.0: 5.3)

Below, we provide details on what these vulnerabilities mean, their potential impact, and recommended mitigation steps.
Vulnerability Details and Mitigation
1. SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted (Plugin ID: 51192)
Description

Severity: Medium
CVSS v3.0 Score: 6.5
What the Report Says: The scan detected that the SSL/TLS certificate used by a service on the target system (IP: 192.168.220.236) is not trusted. This could be due to one or more of the following issues:
The certificate is self-signed.
The certificate is issued by an untrusted or unknown Certificate Authority (CA).
The certificate is expired or not yet valid.
The certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) does not match the hostname or IP address.
The certificate chain is incomplete or improperly configured.


Impact: An untrusted SSL certificate can lead to several risks:
Users may receive warnings in their browsers, reducing trust in the application or service.
Attackers could exploit this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, intercepting sensitive data if users bypass certificate warnings.
It may indicate a misconfiguration in the server’s SSL/TLS setup, which could expose the system to further vulnerabilities.



Mitigation Steps

Verify the Certificate Status:
Check the certificate details using a tool like openssl or a browser to determine why it is untrusted (e.g., expired, self-signed, or mismatched hostname).

Obtain a Trusted Certificate:
Replace self-signed or untrusted certificates with one issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., Let’s Encrypt, DigiCert, or Sectigo).

2. SMB Signing Not Required (Plugin ID: 57608)
Description

Severity: Medium
CVSS v3.0 Score: 5.3
What the Report Says: The scan found that the Server Message Block (SMB) service on the target system does not require SMB signing. SMB signing ensures that SMB packets are digitally signed to verify their authenticity and integrity, preventing tampering or spoofing.
Impact: Without SMB signing, the system is vulnerable to:
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker could intercept or modify SMB communications.
Unauthorized access or data manipulation if an attacker exploits weak authentication mechanisms.
This is particularly risky in environments where sensitive data is shared over SMB (e.g., file shares in a Windows network).



Mitigation Steps

Enable SMB Signing:
For Windows Systems:
Open Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc or gpmc.msc for domain environments).
Navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options.
Enable the following policies:
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)

Alternatively, modify the registry:
Set HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\RequireSecuritySignature to 1.
Set HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\RequireSecuritySignature to 1.

For Windows, configure Windows Firewall to restrict SMB traffic (ports 137-139, 445) to specific IP ranges.
